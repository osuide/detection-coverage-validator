## About This Programme

We believe security is a collaborative effort. The researchers listed here have demonstrated exceptional skill and responsibility by identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in accordance with our [Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](/docs/security-policy).

### Recognition Criteria

To be included in our Hall of Thanks, researchers must:

- Report a valid, unique vulnerability within scope
- Follow our responsible disclosure guidelines
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before any public disclosure
- Not have exploited the vulnerability beyond proof of concept

## Responsible Disclosure

We practise coordinated disclosure. This means:

- We work with researchers to understand and validate findings
- We aim to remediate within published timeframes
- We credit researchers when publishing security advisories
- We do not disclose researcher identities without permission
